FRIENDS NLP Analysis

Description: Scraped episode script data off of https://fangj.github.io/friends/ using BeautifulSoup. Used tools such as Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikitlearn to do my analysis.

Features: These included - Season, Episode, Line, and Character. Used NLTK to remove stopwords.

Analysis: Performed a Sentiment Analysis on the entire show, including each character. Phoebe was generally the happiest while Monica was the least happiest. Created word clouds to understand character interaction. While Ross was more involved with mentioning Rachel, the rest of the characters were mentioning each other fairly equally. Lastly, I did topic modeling using LDA and NMF. Both were fairly similar, but I used LDA to hone in on the top topics, which included: Assurances, explanations, apologies, terms of endearment, and character mentions.

Importance: I wanted to see if the show FRIENDS was more trivial than it seems to be and to see if there were underlying themes. From my analysis, I found that there weren't any patterns and that this show was just really about a group of friends and their lives for ten years.
